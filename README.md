kaleidoscope
============

Kaleidoscope: generate and display random triangles with random colors at user-defined "frame rate." 
Default is 10 frames/sec.  Purpose is to exercise and demonstrate the OCDynamicView class which
features repeated drawing into an offscreen CALayer.  This is useful for math and physics animations 
as well as for procedural/generative art projects.
